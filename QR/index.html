<body><h1>You should not have followed that QR link. Here's why:</h1>
<p>- <strong>Drive By Download Attack:</strong> QR Codes can lead to URLs that forceably download malicious software that could harm your device. This attack is mainly geared towards Android devices but can be executed across a wide span of operating systems and computers.</p>
<p>- <strong>Phishing Attack:</strong> Our QR code could have led to a website with a login form, asking you to login using your IASTATE credentials. A malicious actor could easily harvest your credentials and spend all of your dining dollars...how would you eat?!</p>
<p>- <strong>Harmful Websites:</strong> Websites can be written with code to execute browser exploits - these exploits can turn cameras/microphones on, access browsing history, and even send emails on your behalf. </p>
<h2>Protect yourself from QR codes by using QR scanners that show you the URL. Furthermore, never offer any information (ie., login) to any QR-linked page.</h2>
