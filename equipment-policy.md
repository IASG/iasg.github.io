## Purpose

The purpose of IASG device checkout is to allow IASG members the opportunity to experiment with and explore technology, then share the experience with the rest of the organization.

If you see something cool on the Internet, we want you to learn how to do it and then show it off.

The IASG equipment check-out is intended to allow members to go above and beyond simply attending presentations. Following a presentation, IASG can provide some of the tools needed to try out the activities demonstrated. Additionally, tools can be used in the process of developing presentations to give at future IASG meetings.

Another facet of equipment check-out is target devices. With the advent of the so-called "Internet of Things," many low-quality, low-cost connected devices are emerging. These consumer products often have security issues, and represent a good opportunity for low-hanging fruit with real-world security impact.

### Acquisitions

Preference will be given to devices that can be reused for multiple experiments or presentations. If it is a device that will be hacked and potentially rendered inoperable, low cost is a priority.

### Inventory

A current list of available equipment is maintained on the IASG website. It can be found [here](/equipment)

### Policy

## Checkout Procedures

Contact the IASG President or Equipment Chair to check out equipment. The Equipment Chair will maintain an inventory and log of what equipment is checked out, the dates, and to whom.

## Duration

IASG equipment is checked out for a base two week duration. This can be extended at the discretion of the Equipment Chair following contact prior to the due date. Equipment that is due must be turned back in at the first IASG meeting following the due date.

## IASG "Hacking Tool" Policy

Do not use any IASG loaner equipment in a way contrary to any university policy, local, state, or federal law.

Stay safe, and stay legal.

## IASG Radio Frequency Transmitter Policy

Many devices have wireless capabilities, and experimentation with these capabilities can be very exciting and educational. However, care must be taken to follow the FCC regulations. This is especially true of software-defined radios, but applies to consumer wireless devices as well.

### Restrictions

* Devices which are subject to these restrictions will have the "RF Restrictions" section filled out on the checkout form, with any exceptions noted.
  1. This section will be reviewed before equipment is checked out.
* No IASG member may use any transmit functionality of a checked-out IASG device without prior notice. This specifically includes software-defined radio transceivers.
  1. Any user wishing to transmit must include so on the checkout form. The estimated frequency, must be included on the form, and will be reviewed prior to approval.
  2. IASG does not condone or approve of any illegal use of radio frequencies, and will not approve any use of frequencies that are not licensed to the user.
  3. Any user choosing to transmit is doing so at their own risk, and will be responsible for any fines or other penalties that may be incurred.
  4. Any indication of misuse of the device can result in repossession of the device, reporting to appropriate officials, and/or banning from usage of IASG equipment.
* No IASG member may modify or replace the antennas of any device with transmit capabilities, unless the device is specifically designed to allow this.
  1. The new antenna on the device must be safe to use on the device. This means that the antenna must be designed for the frequency range of the device, and must be designed to handle the power input and output of the device. The member is responsible for ensuring that the antenna is safe to use on the device. Failure to do so may result in damage to the device, and the member will be responsible for the cost of repair or replacement.
  2. The new antenna must not have a primary purpose of increasing the transmit range or power of the device.
* No IASG member may modify the RF functionality of any device firmware.
  1. This includes, but is not limited to, modifying the transmit power, frequency, or modulation of the device.

### Exceptions

* Checkout Form
  1. Off-the-shelf certified devices may be used as intended by the manufacturer without notice. This exception specifically applies to devices that have received proper FCC Equipment Authorization, such as (wifi access points, bluetooth devices, embedded radio modules, remote controls, etc). FCC provides a tool to search for these devices [here](https://www.fcc.gov/oet/ea/fccid)
  2. While an above mentioned device is checked out, the member may use the transmit functionality of the device as intended by the manufacturer.
  3. Largely speaking, if a device includes an FCC ID that matches the product, it will not be questioned, however if there is reasonable suspicion that the device is not original, and could reasonably fall outside the authorization, the specific device may be removed from the exception list.
  4. This does NOT apply to devices that are FCC authorized, but the manufacturer recommends professional installation, to remain in the guidelines of the FCC, such as back-haul wifi equipment.
* Transmit Notice
  1. Any user who can provide a valid [Amateur Radio License](https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/bureau-divisions/mobility-division/amateur-radio-service) or higher with the FCC, is not required to provide notice of their intended transmit at time of checkout.
  2. The user is responsible for operating within the bounds of their license, and will be responsible for any fines or other penalties that may be incurred.
  3. Misuse of the device can still result in the same consequences.
* Antenna Replacement
  1. No current exceptions.
* RF Firmware Modification
  1. If the modification is done as a means to remove transmit functionality, and is reasonably reversible, it is permitted. The device must be returned to its original state before being returned to IASG.
  2. If the modification is done as part of the normal manufacturer intended operation of the device, it is permitted.

## Firmware modification

Firmware modification can often be a risky operation that has a decent chance of resulting in bricked hardware. Firmware modifications are disallowed as a general rule. However, for some devices, firmware modifications are safe and/or an intended part of normal use. For such devices, firmware modifications will be allowed. This is decided on a device-by-device basis, if you have questions, please ask.

Hardware modifications are prohibited as a general rule. Exception can be made with permission from the IASG cabinet.

RF device firmware modifications are subject to the transmitter restrictions as well as the IASG tool policy.

## IASG Target Device Policy

Some loaner devices are intended to be used as targets to be hacked. This includes IoT devices as well as other consumer products that may be interesting to look into for security topics. Since these devices are largely sacrificial, the rules are more lenient.

* Firmware hacking is permitted if done in a reasonably safe manner (This does is still to RF transmitter limitations)
* Bricking is understood to be a possibility
* Hardware modifications are permitted, such as installing debug headers.
