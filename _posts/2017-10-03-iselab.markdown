**This is currently unavailable as of 29 March 2022, but this page is being left as a historical reminder**

Similar to the Information Assurance classes, IASG has been provided with access to a virtualized environment for club members to play around in. Attacks can be conducted
within this environment without worrying about affecting the real world.

You can access the environment through our VPN, SSH hop, or web shell and web browser.

To get started, visit [https://iasg.iac.iastate.edu/iselab](https://iasg.iac.iastate.edu/iselab) and register for an account.

For any issues, reach us in the #iselab channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/3xxec7V5zN) or email us at [iasg-cabinet@iastate.edu](mailto:iasg-cabinet@iastate.edu).
