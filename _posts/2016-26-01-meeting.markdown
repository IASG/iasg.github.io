On Tuesday night, Keane presented "Even more fun with MitM". When an attacker is on your network, nothing is safe, especially not your precious downloads. Learn how MitM attacks can be leveraged to patch and exploit binaries in real time as they are being downloaded over the network, and what measures can be taken to prevent these attacks.

The meeting was in Coover 2245 by 5:15pm Tuesday, 26th January, 2016.
Following the presentation, there was a Lab Jam in Coover 1012 where we explored those concepts in more depth.
