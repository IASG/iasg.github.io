This Tuesday, January 23rd at 5:15PM is our first meeting of the Spring 2018
semester. The meeting will take place in 3043 Coover (third floor).

RSM, an audit and consulting company, will be coming in to discuss a career in
penetration testing. They will also be bringing free Jeff's Pizza! 

From RSM:

> We’ll be doing an overview of pentesting– focusing for the first 10 minutes
or so on what the goals of it are, what the job is like in general, types of
engagements, etc.  We will then shift focus into talking through our
methodology.  This will be a technical talk that outlines a variety of methods
that we use in each step to attain, maintain, and propagate our access (and
include several demos/videos).  The following steps will be covered:
* Footprinting and enumeration
* Initial compromise
* Lateral movement and persistence
* Sensitive data access

Please note the new meeting location!
