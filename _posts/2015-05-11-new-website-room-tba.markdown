    in any feedback you might have.

IASG has a website again!
-------------------------

Jake Drahos has created a new and useful website for IASG. For those
who are interested in the details, it uses an awesome open-source 
static content generator called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.io). Since
Jekyll is a site generator, not a dynamic website framework, the entire
site is generated once then served from static HTML by a webserver.

All of the weekly updates and meeting topics will continue to be sent out
over the mailing list as normal. We aren't replacing the mailing list with
the website, so you don't need to feel obligated to check this site repeatedly.

Room for Fall 2015 TBA
----------------------

We don't yet have our room assignment for Fall. If you have any strong feelings
about what the room should be like, mention it in [Discord](https://discord.gg/3xxec7V5zN) or
send us an email.

Unless we see a very strong reason to change it, our meetings will be held at our usual
time of 5:15 Tuesday evenings.
