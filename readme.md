# Information Assurance Student Group Website

This is the public facing website for the Information Assurance Student Group at Iowa State University. 

If you are looking to download and test the site locally clone the repo into a directory and follow the steps list [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll).

The steps are roughly, install Ruby, and Bundler. Then run `bundle install` to install and update all the sites gems. Then run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to serve the website locally

Doing this will allow you to test the site locally without having to push to the remote repository.
