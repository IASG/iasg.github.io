The Information Assurance Student Group (IASG), a part of the
Center for Cybersecurity Innovation & Outreach at Iowa State University,
holds weekly meetings on information
security topics. These meetings consist of conference-style
presentations about various InfoSec-related topics including
hacking, exploits, recent vulnerabilities in the news,
webapp vulnerabilities, and general hacker subjects such as 
radio, operating systems, and networking.

We often feature guest speakers from the security field, as well
as offer introductory-level presentations for those interested in
security, but without an extensive background in designing
and building information systems.

**Meeting Information**
-------------------

**Time:** 6:00 PM every Thursday for Spring 2022

Slack Chatroom
--------------

The primary communication that IASG uses outside of meetings is the Slack channel. This [Slack](https://iasg.slack.com) chatroom is used to hang out and share information
between meetings. It's worth joining, since members will post cool
tricks, news stories, and other infosec things in the channel. All you need to do is
sign up at <https://iasg.slack.com> with
an @iastate.edu email address.

Mailing List Information
------------------------

IASG maintains an active mailing list for meeting announcements, topics, and
